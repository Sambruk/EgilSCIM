/** This is an advisory file lock for the cache file.
  * Internally this uses boost's named_mutex to coordinate
  * access to the cache file, but in a pragmatic way to
  * suit our needs for the cache file.
  * 
  * Motivation:
  * 
  * 1. We really want to avoid being blocked from writing the new cache file.
  * 2. Under normal circumstances there should be little risk of having to 
  *    wait long for access to the file.
  * 3. There could be other processes accessing the file (such as a backup script)
  *    which won't respect our advisory locking anyway, so the writing to the
  *    cache file will anyway need to implement a retry in case the filesystem
  *    blocks the rename when we're done writing.
  * 4. boost's named_mutex can throw an interprocess_error, if the interprocess
  *    implementation isn't working for some reason we don't want that to be
  *    enough of a reason not to write the cache file.
  * 5. If we fail to get the lock within a reasonable time, the most likely explanation
  *    is not that others are accessing it, but that the named_mutex hasn't been properly
  *    released (for instance it the process is hard killed while holding the mutex).
  * 
  * All this put together leads to an implementation which tries to take the
  * named mutex but with a timeout. If we fail to take the mutex (either by timeout or
  * a problem with the interprocess system), we'll carry on as if we have the mutex
  * (and remove it from the system so we won't need to wait next time).
  * 
  * In other words, under normal circumstances this will block multiple instances of
  * EgilSCIMClient from accessing the file at once, but it's not a 100% guarantee.
  * We're ok with that since we're anyway retrying the writes.
