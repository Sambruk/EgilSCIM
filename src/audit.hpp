/**
 * Logs an message as a result of a SCIM operation (either a successful or

 * The log message is meant to be readable and will follow a somewhat 
 * predictable pattern, but is not completely structured for easy parsing.
 * 
 * The function will do nothing if os is not an opened stream.
 * 
 * previous refers to a version of the object which had been sent before,
 * current refers to the current version. 
 * 
 * Whether or not current and previous are nullptrs will partly depend on
 * which operation was performed, but there are exceptions (for instance
 * if the operation failed because the current object couldn't be rendered,
 * or if the operation was done during a "rebuild cache").
 * 
 * In other words the log message, when describing the object, will try to
 * use the most suitable object, or in the worst case just the UUID.
 * 
 * To describe the objects, they will be parsed if possible and we'll use
 * SS12000 knowledge to choose an appropriate readable description for the 
 * object (for instance, for users we will use the userName).
