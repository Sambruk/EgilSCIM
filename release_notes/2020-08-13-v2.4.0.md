# Version 2.4.0 (2020-08-13)

This is a minor release with only two new features.

## Support for post processing by plugins

The EGIL client allows for quite a bit of flexibility in its configuration.
At the same time, the client tries to stay general and can't cater to every
need.

The new system for post processing gives you the possibility of applying any
kind of transformation to the data, just before it's sent to the server. The
transformations are done by plugins which can be re-used, or you can write your
own if you know a bit of programming.

For more information, see [Post processing](../doc/POST-PROCESSING.md) .

## Support for paged LDAP queries

Some LDAP servers impose a limit on the number of objects returned in response
to LDAP queries. If there are very many objects in your directory this may
cause the EGIL client to fail.

Usually the easiest solution, and the one that gives best performance, is to
simply increase the limit in your LDAP server. If that's not an option, you
can now enable paged searches in the client (assuming your LDAP server
supports the paging extension).

Switch it on by setting the new variable `ldap-page-size` to a number suitable
for your LDAP server, e.g.:

```
ldap-page-size = 2000
```
