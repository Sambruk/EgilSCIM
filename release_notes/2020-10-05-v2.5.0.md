# Version 2.5.0 (2020-10-05)

This is a minor release with only one new feature.

## Support for relational databases (SQL) as data source

The EGIL client can now load objects from a relational database
by executing SQL queries.

Since different databases have different interfaces, a plugin is
needed to talk to your database. Plugins are not included in the
open source version of the EGIL client.

For more information, see [Usage](../doc/USAGE.md) .
