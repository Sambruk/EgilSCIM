# EGIL SCIM client

This is a further development of the SimpleSCIM poc project implementing groups,
mainly for sending information of students and teachers and how they are
organised in groups.
It is not limited to this, though. The programme can
read many types of relations from an ldap source and create Group scim messages
of any type. Special treatment for types not availiable in ldap has been implemented.
Those types are not required though.

Configuration examples will be made availiable

The directory `src` contains the source code for EgilSCIM, the
directory `test` contains test code for EgilSCIM, the directory
`doc` contains detailed documentation for using EgilSCIM and the
directory `res` contains other resources.
