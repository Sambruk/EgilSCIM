A medium sized generated scenario using the same model schema as in
the base scenario.

There are:

 2 school units.
 100 groups (50 per school unit)
 1000 students (500 per school unit)
 100 teachers (50 per school unit)

The number of members in each group varies, in total there are 1000
membership relations per school unit.

Some teachers or students are not in any group and will thus not be sent
to the SCIM server.
